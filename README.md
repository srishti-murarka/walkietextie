# Walkie Textie: Short-Range Texting Communicator

## Project Overview

This project introduces the **Walkie-Textie**, a short-range, localized communication device that works like a pager. It uses an **Arduino Mega microcontroller** as the central processing unit, allowing message exchange using a radio transceiver module. The messages are displayed on an **OLED screen**, and user input is captured via a **4x3 keypad matrix**. The Walkie-Textie utilizes an **nRF24L01 radio transceiver** to ensure messages are received reliably, even in areas with limited signal strength.

## Components Used

### Hardware

- **Arduino Mega 2560 R3:** The central controller for reading and processing data.
- **nRF24L01 module:** The radio transceiver for efficient wireless communication.
- **OLED Display:** The screen displays text messages for a simplified user experience.
- **4x3 Matrix Membrane Keypad:** Mapped as an alpha-numeric keyboard for text input.

### Software

- **Arduino IDE:** The integrated development environment used for writing, compiling, and uploading the code to the Arduino board.
